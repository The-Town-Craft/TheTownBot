# The Town Bot

## Core Plugin for The Town Discord/Minecraft server!

- Adds custom dimensions, mobs, items, and bosses
- Links the Discord & Minecraft Chat
- Many Essential Minecraft Features
- Player Activity System with built in AFK detection
- Many other utilities for staff such as ModMail
- The ability to run Minecraft commands from Discord!

## Use [this invite](https://discord.gg/78jUErB) to join the Discord!

Unlike most bots, this one cannot be invited, as it is made specifically for The Town. However, with some editing, this source code can be used to make a bot for any server!

## How it works

This bot has the same functionality of a normal Discord bot, except it is actually part of a spigot plugin. That is how the bot, and the plugin can communicate so easily; they are part of the same program!
